## [Project 1: Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Tandon-A/MLEND_Udacity/tree/master/sentiment_analysis) 

This project aims to build a recurrent neural network to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB dataset. The model is developed using Amazon Sagemaker service and is deployed to use in a simple web application. 

## [Project 2: Plagiarism Detection](https://github.com/Tandon-A/MLEND_Udacity/tree/master/plagiarism_detection) 

The goal of this project is to build a plagiarism detector. The trained binary classification model labels a text file as either plagiarised or not depending upon its similarity with a source text. The model is trained and deployed using Amazon Sagemaker. 

## [Project 3: Capstone Project](https://github.com/Tandon-A/MLEND_Udacity/tree/master/Capstone_Project) 

This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks for the task of recognizing emotions using facial expressions. CNN model is trained using PyTorch library on the FER 2013 dataset. A simple web application which uses the trained CNN model to predict emotions in static images is developed using Flask and is deployed using Heroku.
